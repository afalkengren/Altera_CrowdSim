# Altera CrowdSim

## Timeline
Originally there I put a fallback period from 5th April - 5th May in case of delays. 
This is now in action, so all deadlines are shifted forward by a month. 
Some delays were had because I had an encryption problem and had to wipe, rolling back to a version on git.

- Map kernel to FPGA/OpenCL 1.2 - 17th April
- Include profiling and optimize code - 24th April
- Take the final measurements of the kernel - 5th May
- *If possible implement graphic visualization* (5th May-5th June)
- Submit abstract + draft - 5th June
- Submit final report - 21st June
